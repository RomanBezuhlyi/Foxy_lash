          Permanent makeup technique that enhances the natural beauty of the
          lips by adding a subtle, semi-permanent color. It involves depositing
          pigments into the lips using a specialized needle and technique,
          resulting in a soft, natural-looking tint. Lip blush can help define
          the shape of the lips, add a youthful flush of color, and create the
          appearance of fuller and more symmetrical lips.

          This technique involves the application of pigments along the lash
          line to create a long-lasting and defined eyeliner look. It is a form
          of cosmetic tattooing that can eliminate the need for daily eyeliner
          application. The color and thickness of the eyeliner can be tailored
          to suit individual preferences and desired outcomes. The results can
          last for several years, gradually fading over time.
