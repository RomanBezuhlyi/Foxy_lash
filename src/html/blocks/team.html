        <h5>Meet Inna</h5>
        <p style="-webkit-line-clamp: 6">
          “Hi, my name is Inna! My passion for beauty started at 14 years old. I
          loved to make women look more beautiful, than they already were. I was
          19 years old when I moved from Ukraine to New York. I worked a few
          jobs out of the beauty industry until I finally made the decision in
          2012 to go to beauty school, so I could get my license and start
          working with women. I started doing makeup and became very successful,
          working on brides and famous people but I wanted more. That's when I
          decided to start doing lashes and permanent makeup. I started doing
          lashes and PMU in 2016 and moved to LA, so I had to start from zero. I
          built a large clientele and was finally happy doing what I always
          wanted to do since I was 14 years old. In July of 2023 I decided to
          move to Miami. Now here I am! Starting from zero again but very
          excited for what's coming. I hope to see you at Foxy soon.”

        <h5>Meet Bahar</h5>
        <p style="-webkit-line-clamp: 6">
          “Hi! I am Bahar. It´s my nickname that everyone calls me! I was born
          in 1990 and grew up in Iran. I started permanent makeup when I was 18
          years old and shortly after learned how to do lash extensions. I love
          doing these services because they stimulate my love for art and
          beauty! I moved to Turkey when I was 24 years old. It was challenging
          being far from my family, learning a new language, meeting new people
          and finding work; but I did it and became one of the best in the city!
          Today I’m here in South Florida with new challenges and starting once
          again. So far it has been great! I have been with Foxy Lash Boutique
          for over a year now and love it more and more every day! The girls
          here are real artists full of compassion, inspiration and good energy.
          I love pampering my clients and love making them feel more beautiful
          than they already are. Hope to see you soon!”
