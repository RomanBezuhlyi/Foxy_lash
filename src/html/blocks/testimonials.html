                Danielle the owner was very accommodating and patient with all
                the questions I asked since it was my first time. She set me up
                with the appt that suited me best and set me up with Dario who
                also was very patient and professional with the repeated
                questions. Helped me choose what I wanted and made sure I was
                happy with the lashes before I left. Highly recommend them. The
                salon and chairs are inviting and comfortable.

                LOVE. LOVE. LOVE THIS PLACE. I've been going to Foxy Lash
                Boutique off & on for years now. Even though I don't go there a
                lot they still remember me. I love how they save my information
                from the times that I have gone because I like to change up the
                types of eye lash sets that I get done & I don't always remember
                what I've gotten done the last ti.e I've gone, so this is very
                helpful. I never go anywhere else. I always recommend them to
                family & friends. Especially when I see they've gotten their
                lashes done somewhere else. They don't get it until they see my
                lashes done. Foxy Lash just does an amazing job... its all in
                the work they put in that makes ppl understand why I recommend
                them. I would also like to thank Raquel who did my wet mascara
                technique. She was very sweet & professional. I can't say enough
                good things about this place. If u haven't tried tried them yet
                I Don't Know What Your Waiting For! üòã
