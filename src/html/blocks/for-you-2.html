                    <h2><b>HydraFacial Scalp</b> Treatment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Innovative procedure designed to rejuvenate and nourish the scalp, promoting healthier hair growth and overall scalp
                        health. Using the same patented vortex suction technology as the traditional HydraFacial, this treatment deeply cleanses
                        the scalp, removes buildup, and unclogs hair follicles. <span>
                            It also provides hydration and delivers essential nutrients to
                            the scalp, such as peptides, vitamins, growth factors and antioxidants, which can help strengthen hair follicles and
                            improve hair quality.
                        </span>                        
                        <br /><br />
                        The treatment is soothing and comfortable, with no downtime, making it suitable for all hair types and scalp conditions.
                        It's an effective way to address issues like dryness, flakiness, excess oil production, and even mild scalp conditions
                        like dandruff.

                        <span>
                            The HydraFacial Scalp Treatment is typically recommended as a three-month program, with treatments scheduled one month
                            apart for optimal results.
                        </span> Consistency is key to achieving amazing results, as each session builds upon the previous one
                        to improve scalp health, promote hair growth, and enhance overall hair quality.
