                    HydraFacial treatment is a non-invasive, multi-step facial rejuvenation procedure that combines cleansing, exfoliation,
                    extraction, hydration, and antioxidant protection. It uses a unique vortex suction technology to deeply cleanse and
                    hydrate the skin, leaving it refreshed, revitalized, and glowing.

                    Clients undergoing HydraFacial treatment have the option to personalize their experience by selecting from various
                    boosters tailored to address specific skin concerns. <b>Choices include collagen for skin elasticity, energizing for
                    revitalization, or clarifying boosters for congested skins.</b>
